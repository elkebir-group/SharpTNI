# Simulated Data

We provide a script runSharpTNIsimulation.sh that will execute our
method on the simulated data. To run the script the following
executables and scripts must be in this folder
  1. sankoff
  2. dimacs
  3. approxmc
  4. unigen
  5. UniGen2.py

The script generates 11000 uniformly drawn samples of SharpTNI
solutions for each case.
