# Data

## Sample

Sample phylogenetic tree and host files provided in code readable for
example runs.

## Simulation

Simulated data of outbreak with different number of nodes and bottleneck
sizes separated in different folders. For example, folder m5_kappa3 has
data generated for outbreak with 5 sampled hosts with a bottleneck size
of 3.

## Ebola

This folder has the fasta file with 81 aligned EBOV genomic sequences
collected from patients of the 2014 Sierra Leone Ebola outbreak. It also
has input files readable for SCOTTI script to generate the xml file that
